# Changes

## v0.1.6
### Weapon belonging updates
You can now tell whether a weapon has Qualities and Effects at a glance.  If a
Weapon belonging has a description, you can click the weapon to reveal it just
like you would on a Talent.

### Other changes
* Plugin sets the "show map notes" to default to true, to improve the discoverability of map notes.
* Tab buttons are more accessible; can be used via keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### Bugfixes
* Mouse-clicking on the button to increase max/min stress was not working (keyboards worked).
* Input listeners were added to sheets that a player wouldn't be able to edit if they wanted to.

## v0.1.5
### Added partial support for STA System v1.2 and up

Supports the new "Stress Modifier" addition to characters, but a replacement
for the 2nd Edition character sheets has not beed provided.  You may modify
your maximum Stress by clicking the up/down buttons next to the "Stress Track"
title, located directly above the track itself.
