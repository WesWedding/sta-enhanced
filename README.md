# Star Trek Adventures: Enhanced #

A plugin that enhances the [Unofficial Star Trek Adventures system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sta)
with fresher tab-based navigation to improve readability, organization, and
a few new bells and whistles.

## Requirements
- Foundry v12 or later
- Foundry v12 Client or Latest Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

## New Features and Updates ##

### Tabs! ###
The sheet provided by the system is a single page and very cramped, requiring
the squishing a lot of a lot of detail into the lower section of the sheet.
Several official Foundry Systems use tabs manage this issue, moving details
to additional tabs and allowing the inputs to have breathing room.

Many sheet elements live in dedicated tabs now.

- Details
  - Species, assignment, rank, traits, personality (new!),
    Gender/Pronouns (new!)
- Belongings
  - Weapons, armor, and other items can be found here.
- Reputation
  - Fields related to the reputation system goes here.
- Biography
  - The notes field, environment and upbringing, and Biography (new!) go here.

### New fields! ###
The introduction of tabs also means we have space to add additional fields that can
help you flesh out your character more without having to rely on Journal pages
or external notes.

- Personality: It can be helpful to write this down, especially if you're a GM
  and have to switch between several characters or otherwise need a reminder to
  get in-character.
- Gender/Pronouns: Sometimes it can be hard to keep pronouns straight when all
  you have are alien names and portraits.  Maybe you have a species that
  doesn't use the typical Earth gender dynamics at all!  It's sci-fi, anything
  can happen!
- Biography: The Notes field provided by the System was really tiny, but there
  is also a difference between a Biography and Notes.  Put your fancy backstory
  here, instead.  Plenty of space is given for this purpose.

### New Editors ###
Text editors have been updated from the TinyMCE editor to ProseMirror (TinyMCE
will eventually get deprecated).  A side effect of this means that the minimum
supporting Foundry version supported is Foundry v10.

## Hypothetical Future Features ##
- Cleaner Weapon sheets - Clearly defined "Effects" and "Qualities" sections
  with room for custom qualities.
- Improved labelling of chat cards when sharing Values, Talents, and Focuses.
- Career Events!  These are not tracked on any official sheets nor any VTT sheets,
  but they seem like really useful background information for a GM to refer to.
