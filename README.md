# Star Trek Adventures: Enhanced #

A plugin that enhances the [Unofficial Star Trek Adventures system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sta)
with fresher tab-based navigation to improve readability, organization, and add
a few new bells and whistles.

### New Features (hypothetically speaking) ###
- Tabs - Splitting the sheet content into tabs helps give some breathing room
  for elements to be sized bigger and have some more breathing room, allowing
  for impoved readability.
- Biographical Background - The absymally tiny "notes" field did not really
  cut it for a biography.  Now there's a whole tab where a player can write
  an extensive biography.
- Cleaner Weapon sheets - Clearly defined "Effects" and "Qualities" sections
  with room for custom qualities.
- Clearly labelled panels when sharing Values, Talents, and Focuses.
